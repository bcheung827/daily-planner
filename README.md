# daily-planner
**Project Description**
The purpose of this project is to create a daily planner where the user can input text in a certain hour (between 9am-5pm) and save the text to local storage. When the text is saved and the page is refreshed the inputted text should remain in the designated location. The text boxes also correlate to the current time where if the hour is in the past, the text box will appear to be red. If it is the current time, the text box will appear grey. If it is in a future time, the text box will appear as green.
